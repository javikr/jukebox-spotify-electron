Requirements
------------

* Mac OS X 10.8 or later
* Windows 7 or later.
* Spotify desktop app installed.


Development
-----------

This project was made using [Electron][4] and uses npm package manager and bower to handle all its dependencies. It depends on the Spotify API to make all the API calls to obtain tracks, playlists, user data, etc..
The Jukebox acts as a frontend for the Spotify desktop app so it needs the Spotify desktop app running while the Jukebox app is open.
